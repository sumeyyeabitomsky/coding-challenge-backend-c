### Prerequisites

You are going to need:

- `Git`
- `nvm` (or your preferred node version manager)
- `Node.js`

### Setting up your environment

1. Begin by forking this repo and cloning your fork. GitHub has apps for [Mac](http://mac.github.com/) and
[Windows](http://windows.github.com/) that make this easier.

2. Install [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#install--update-script) or your preferred node version manager.

3. Install [Node.js](http://www.nodejs.org).

### Setting up the project

In the project directory run:

```
nvm use
npm install
```

### Running the tests

The test suite can be run with:

```
npm run test
```

### Starting the application

To start a local server run:

```
npm run start
```

it should produce an output similar to:

```
Server running at http://127.0.0.1:2345/suggestions
```
